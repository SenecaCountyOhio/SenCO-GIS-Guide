# Eagleview Imagery

Every few years, Seneca County has a company fly over the county to get new and updated imagery for the county. When the imagery is delivered to the Auditor's office, it is on a
external hard drive with the files in folders. You will want to find the Area-wide Mosaics and import them into ARCGis Pro. Then you will want to use the Create Map Tile Package geoprocessing tool to conbine all of the mosaic tiles into one package. THIS PROCESS WILL TAKE TIME. After the tool is finished, you will have a single file that has the entirety of the aerial imagery of Seneca County.
