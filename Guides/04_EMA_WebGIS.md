# Seneca County EMA WebGIS

The Seneca County [Emergency Management Association](https://senecacountyohio.gov/seneca-county-emergency-services/)
partnered with Motorola to manage 9-1-1 calls. Motorola has a WebGIS product
called Emergency CallWorks which they maintain for the EMA. The Seneca County
Auditor's Office, as the Primary Addressing Authority and central GIS Operation
in Seneca Ceounty, provides them updated data regularly. Motorola only updates
the WebGIS once a month, and so there is a scheduled task that runs the first of
every month. The script is located here "B:\\Projects\\Automated Tasks\\ECW". Most
of the data they need is very rarely updated. Currently only Addresses are
updated monthly.
