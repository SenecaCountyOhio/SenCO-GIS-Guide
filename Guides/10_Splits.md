# Property Splits & Combinations

When a parcel is split or combined, the land type acreage breakdown must be calculated for each parcel. To quickly do this, the Auditor's Office partners with a 3rd Party Vendor, [Bruce Harris](http://www.bruceharris.com/). Bruce Harris has a ArcGIS Extension called the "Farmland Calculator", which performs the analysis on any selected parcel.

*Note: The extension is currently only available for ArcGIS Desktop.*

Alex Rodd wrote a detailed set of instructions (with screenshots), to show users how to use the tool. The instructions are located here;

*Note: I updated Alex's inustructions since the land use layer's structure was changed slightly. You can read more about that [here](./06_Land_Use.md)*
