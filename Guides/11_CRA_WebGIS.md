# Community Reinvestment Areas WebGIS

The following is a description of Community Reinvestment Areas by The Ohio Development Services Agency;

>  The Ohio Community Reinvestment Area program is an economic development tool administered by municipal and county government that provides real property tax exemptions for property owners who renovate existing or construct new buildings. Community Reinvestment Areas are areas of land in which property owners can receive tax incentives for investing in real property improvements.

>  The Community Reinvestment Area (CRA) Program is a direct incentive tax exemption program benefiting property owners who renovate existing or construct new buildings.  This program permits municipalities or counties to designate areas where investment has been discouraged as a CRA to encourage revitalization of the existing housing stock and the development of new structures.

To assist the Seneca County Auditor and Seneca-Tiffin Economic Partnership in maintaining and analyzing CRAs, and to make CRA information more available to public, a Dashboard application was built using ArcGIS Online.
