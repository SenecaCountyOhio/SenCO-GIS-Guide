# Seneca County Auditor WebGIS

The [Seneca County Auditor](http://www.senecacountyauditor.org), has
a [WebGIS](http://www.senecacountyauditor.org/Map.aspx) that is used internally
and by the public to view tax records and parcel information. The WebGIS and
website is maintained by a company called DDTI. The Seneca County Auditor's
Office provides them updated data regularly. The data configurations are
slightly different, so a script was developed to automate this process. The
script is located at "B:\\Projects\\Automated Tasks\\DDTI".
