The Fostoria visitor's center and Chamber of Commerce reached out to the Seneca County Auditor's office to create a useable community map that they could use to help people navigate around the city if they are new. They previously tried hiring outside contractors but were never pleased with the results.

This map will be a work in progress that can be updated at any time if they see fit, and should never be marked as "complete".

Currently, there is the imagery layer as the base layer for the map, with a shapefile for the city bounds of Fostoria on top of that. Then there is the layer for buildings in Hancock county and buildings in Seneca. Wood county didn't have any layers that could be aquired or used for this project, so I digitized the buildings within the city bounds that are in Wood county for this project and are apart of the "Building_Footprints" layer.

The city of Fostoria can request a change to the map at any time and their requests should be accomodated to the best of the GIS person's ability.
