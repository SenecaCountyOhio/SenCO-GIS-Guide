This document outlines many of the responsibilities of this position.
I have edited, contributed to, and re-organized notes left by Alex Rodd in 2018
in order to produce this document. He provided context as to how much of the
important data was created and is maintained.


In general, I have broken up the GIS position's responsibilities into three
general project types; Ongoing, Annual, and Special.



Ongoing Projects | General Description

	Ongoing projects are tasks and responsibilities that will never have a due
	date. These projects are maintained regularly, some even on a daily basis.
	Many of these processes have been automated. The scheduled tasks related to
	this position are under "GIS_Scripts" in the Windows Task Scheduler app.

Ongoing Projects | Seneca County Parcel Layer


Ongoing Projects | Addressing

	The previous individual responsible for assigning Addresses was Mike Klaiss at
	the Seneca County Emergency Management Association. His email is
	Mklaiss@senecacountyohio.gov and his phone number is 419 447-0266 Ext 13. Mike
	Klaiss is retiring in 2020, so if he no longer works there, contact Brendan
	Cullen.
